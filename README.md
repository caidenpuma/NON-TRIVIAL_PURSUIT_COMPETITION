# NON-TRIVIAL_PURSUIT_COMPETITION
This project implements autonomous drone algorithms for a competitive predator-prey simulation in MATLAB. The challenge involves creating strategies for both a predator drone attempting to catch prey and a prey drone trying to escape, operating within realistic physical constraints including gravity, drag, fuel limitations, and crash mechanics.
